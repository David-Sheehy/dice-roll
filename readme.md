A command line dice rolling simulator. I created this because I wanted to
quickly make pointless decisions without pulling out my collection of dice.
  
Treat this program like a coin toss with an arbitrary number of faces.  

# dice notation
ndm means roll an m sided die n times.

#usage
dice_roll.py 1d2
